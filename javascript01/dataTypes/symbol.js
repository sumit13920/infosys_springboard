/* A "symbol represents a unique identifier. You can make use of Symbol() to generate a value of this type." */
//Example:

//empid is a new symbol
//let empid = Symbol();

/* Also, a description of the symbol generated can be provided which can be mostly used as a name during debugging. */
//Example:

//empid is a symbol with the description "empno"
// let empid = Symbol("empno");

/* Even if various symbols are created with the same description, they are diffferent valuse. Thus, symbols ensures uniqueness. So the description provided can be considered as just a label. */

let empid1 = Symbol("empno");
let empid2 = Symbol("empno");

alert(empid1 == empid2);//false

/*Here both the symbols have the same description but are never considered equal.*/

/* Unlike other values, a symbol value doesn't follow auto-convert. */

//Example:
// let empid = Symbol("empno");
// alert(empid); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string

/* This is a rule because strings and symbols are basically different and should not accidentally get converted to the other one.

But if it is a must to display the Symbol, then the following can be done: */

//Example:
// let empid = Symbol("empno");
// alert(empid.toString());//Symbol(empno), now it worksvalue to a string
//OR

//use description
let empid = Symbol("empno");
alert(empid.description); // empno

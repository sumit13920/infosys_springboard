/*The Array is a special data structure that is used to store an ordered collection, which cannot be achieved using the objects.  

There are two ways of creating an array: */

// let dummyArr = new Array();
//OR
let dummyArr = [];

/*Either array can be declared as empty and can be assigned with value later, or can have the value assigned during the declaration. */

//Example:
digits =[1,2,3,"four"];

/*A single array can hold multiple values of different data types. */

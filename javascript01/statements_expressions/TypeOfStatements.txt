In JavaScript, the statements can be classified into two types.
1.Conditional
2.Non-Conditional

1.Conditional Statements:

conditional statements help you to decide based on certain conditions.
These conditions are specified by a set of conditional statements having boolean expressions that are evaluated to a boolean value true or false.

2.Non-Conditional Statements:
Non-Conditional statements are those statements that do not need any condition to control the program execution flow.

2. Non - conditional statements
There are times when during the iteration of the block of code with the loop, the block execution may be required to be skipped for a specific value and then continue to execute the block for all the other values.
JavaScript gives a 'continue' statement to handle this.

Continue Statements is used to terminate the current iteration of the loop and continue execution of the loop with the nextiteration.

Syntax:
Continue;

Below example shows for loop with five itearations which increment variable "counter".
When loop counter = 3, the current iteration is skipped and moved to the next iteration.
Also, shown below is the value of the counter and the variable loop for every iteration of the loop.

var counter = 0;
for (var loop = 0; loop < 5; loop++) {
    if (loop == 3)
        continue;
    counter++
}

|loopVAr|             counter
|0      |1
|1      |2
|2      |3
|3      |iteration terminated.Hence counter is not incremented.
|4      |4

The 'if' statement used in the example is a contitional / decision-making statement.


Type of Conditional Statements

1. if- Else 
2. Switch Case 


Example:
let workingHours = 9.20;
let additional Hours;
(workingHours > 9.15) ? additionalHOurs = "YOU have positive additional hours" : additionalHours = "You have negative additional hours";
console.log(additionalHours);


If Statements

if...else ladder is used to check for a new condition when the first condition evaluates to false.

Syntax:
if(condition1) {
    //block of code that will be executed if condition1 is true
}
else if (condition2) {
    //block of code that will be executed if the condition1 false and condition2 is true
}
else {
    // block of code that will be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}

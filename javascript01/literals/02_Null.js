/* 
null 

The null value represents "no object". 

Null data type is required as JavaScript variable intended to be assigned with the object at a later point in the program can be assigned null during the declaration.
*/

// Example1:
let item = null;
// variable item is intended to be assigned with object later. Hence null is assigned during variable declaration.

document.write(item==null);

/*  Note: 'document' is an object that represents the HTML document rendered on the browser window and write() method helps one to populate HTML expressions or JavaScript code directly to the document.
